# Lecture 13 - Testing


## Basic Unit Testing

Welcome to the wonderful world of Test Driven Development (TDD)!
For this exercise, you're going to be fixing already written test cases.

1. `git clone https://github.com/Sresht/lect13`
2. Run the success tests: `python split_test.py SplitTestCase.test_split_success`
3. Run the failure tests: `python split_test.py SplitTestCase.test_split_failure`
4. Read through the code with your in-class partners and understand what's
   happening.
5. Fix those test cases by modifying the test code 
    (you should not need to modify `test_split_success` or `test_split_failure`)
6. Add your own success case and your own failure case!
