Get started by running `git clone https://github.com/Sresht/lect13`

## Basic Unit Testing

Welcome to the wonderful world of Test Driven Development (TDD)!
For this exercise, you're going to be fixing already written test cases.

1. Run the success tests: `python split_test.py SplitTestCase.test_split_success`
2. Run the failure tests: `python split_test.py SplitTestCase.test_split_failure`
3. Read through the code with your in-class partners and understand what's
   happening.
4. Fix those test cases by modifying the test code 
    (you should not need to modify `test_split_success` or `test_split_failure`)
5. Add your own success case and your own failure case!


## Treat Yo Self (To Unit Tests)

1. Run the success tests: `python chatbot_test.py ChatbotTestCase.test_parse_message_success`
2. Read through the code with your in-class partners and understand what's
   happening.
3. Fix those text cases by modify the test code
    (you should not need to modify `test_parse_message_success`)
4. For homework, add at least one additional success test and at least 3 failure tests.
